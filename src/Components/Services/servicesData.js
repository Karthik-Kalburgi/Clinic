    ✔️ Irregular heartbeat (palpitations)
    ✔️ Shortness of breath
    ✔️ Dizziness or fainting
    ✔️ High blood pressure or existing heart conditions`,

• These electrodes capture the heart’s electrical signals, which are displayed as a graph on a monitor or paper.
• The procedure is non-invasive, painless, and takes just a few minutes.`,

    why: `Your doctor may recommend a 2D Echo if you have:
✔️ Shortness of breath or unexplained fatigue
✔️ Chest pain or suspected heart disease
✔️ A history of heart attack or heart failure
✔️ Irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias)
✔️ Suspected valve or congenital heart defects`,
    content: `- A gel is applied to the chest, and a transducer (ultrasound probe) is placed on the skin.
- The transducer emits sound waves that create detailed moving images of the heart.
- The procedure is painless, takes 15-30 minutes, and does not involve radiation.`,
    detect:`Your doctor may recommend a 2D Echo if you have:
    📌 Evidence of a Heart Attack– Identifies weakened heart muscle regions due to a heart attack.
  📌 Heart Function & Pumping Efficiency – Measures ejection fraction (EF) to assess how well the heart pumps blood.
  📌 Valve Abnormalities – Detects narrowed or leaky heart valves affecting blood flow.
  📌 Structural Defects – Identifies congenital heart defects and chamber abnormalities.
  📌 Fluid Around the Heart – Detects pericardial effusion indicating infection or inflammation.
  📌 Blood Clots & Tumors – Helps identify clots (thrombus) and abnormal masses inside the heart.
  📌 Pulmonary Hypertension – Assesses lung blood pressure to diagnose related conditions.
  📌 Infections & Inflammation – Detects endocarditis (valve infection) and myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation).

    Holter monitoring is typically recommended to:
    ✔️ Detect intermittent arrhythmias – that may not be captured in a short ECG.
    ✔️ Evaluate symptoms – like palpitations, dizziness, or fainting that may be related to irregular heartbeats.
    ✔️ Assess treatment effectiveness – to check if medications for arrhythmias are working properly.`,

It provides a detailed picture of how your blood pressure changes throughout the day and night, helping to diagnose high blood pressure (hypertension) and other related conditions.",
    why: `
    It is commonly recommended to:
    ✔️ Diagnose hypertension – by measuring blood pressure at different times to identify persistent high readings.
✔️ Evaluate white coat syndrome – where blood pressure is high in a medical setting but normal at home.
✔️ Monitor blood pressure control – for patients already on medication for hypertension to see if the treatment is effective.
✔️ Assess blood pressure variations – such as nocturnal hypertension (high blood pressure at night) or morning surges.
✔️ Identify masked hypertension – when blood pressure is normal at the doctor’s office but high at home.

You can detect the following with 24-Hour Blood Pressure Monitoring:
📌 True blood pressure levels – by recording readings during regular activities and sleep.
📌 Fluctuations in blood pressure – that could be linked to specific activities or times of day.
📌 White coat or masked hypertension – to distinguish between readings taken in the clinic and those in a normal setting.
📌 Nocturnal hypertension – when blood pressure remains high during the night increasing the risk of cardiovascular problems.`,

✔️ Assess exercise-induced symptoms – like chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness to identify possible heart-related causes.
✔️ Evaluate heart rhythm abnormalities (arrhythmias) – triggered by physical exertion.
✔️ Check for exercise tolerance – in patients recovering from heart surgery or a heart attack.
✔️ Assess risk of heart disease – especially for individuals with a history of high blood pressure, diabetes, or family history of heart disease.`,

detect:` You can detect the following with a Treadmill Stress Test:
📌 Reduced Blood Flow to the Heart – Can indicate potential blockages in coronary arteries.
📌 Heart Rhythm Problems – Can help identify arrhythmias triggered by exercise.
📌 Heart Function & Endurance – Assesses how well your heart performs during increased physical activity.`,
